# Adaboost Algorithm Applied to Tic-Tac-Toc Games

Boosting is the process of reducing the bias of a large set of simple models. These models are called weak models, and they are slightly correlated with the correct classification. In this work, the Adaboost algorithm will be implemented in order to classify a set of tic-tac-toe data.
